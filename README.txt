Program developed in PyCharm. Run in the console "python hexbin.py" to start up the bot.
.env file required to load your custom discord token and server/guild name. My .env file is not included for security reasons (obviously).

Your .env file should look something like this...

# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=*insert bot token*
DISCORD_GUILD=*insert server name*
